This here is a comment block. It will not be rendered in the final output.
I can add a code of how the table was generated. for example.
The easiest option is to "past them" in Markdown format.


code:
ssc install frause
frause oaxaca, clear
label define female 0 "Men" 1 "Women", modify
label values female female
estpost tabstat lnwage educ exper tenure , by(female) columns(statistics)
esttab using table1.txt, cell(mean) unstack nomtitle nonumber collabel(none) noobs md

and include it here using

`{{< include table1.txt >}}` (without the backticks)
